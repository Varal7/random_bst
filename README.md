# Benchmark random BST

An experimental inquiry into __zip trees__, the randomized binary tree data structure [recently proposed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06726) by Tarjan _et al._
We compare the empirical performance of zip trees along a number of axes with a variety of classic data structures, including
* __Treaps__
* __Skip lists__, a randomized linked-list-based structure.
* __Splay trees__, a self-adjusting data structure that is [conjectured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree#Dynamic_optimality_conjecture)
to be a competitively optimal BST.
